## What is iBMSC?

- iBMSC is a Be-Music Source (BMS) creator and editor with graphical user interface. 
- It supports most present BMS files.
- It has customizable themes to adapt to most BMS players and simulators.
- It is multilingual.
- It supports longnote visualization, and has two input modes to help users from both BMSE and NT. 
- It supports automatic calculations of BPM.
- It supports perfect free grid.
- It is free!

## System Dependencies

- .NET Framework 2.0+

## Code Release Notes

As I'm having much less time and energy to maintain iBMSC than I was (and for quite a few years already), I'm releasing the source code to the public for those interested in modifying it or just curious.

Though please be aware that since I was a giant noob when I was doing this project (I only started receiving a proper computer science course after version 2.4 is released), don't expect quality code. This codebase has pretty much every bad programming practice you can imagine - god class, stringly typed objects, gotos, no collection type other than arrays (not even arraylists), just to name a few. After releasing version 3.0, I realized how much of a pain it is to maintain such a codebase, so I started rewriting the whole program using better libraries and coding practices, which until now is still far from being done due to increasing amount of school work and other life responsibilities coming along, forcing me to move on with my life.

Also, please allow me to express my gratitude to those who has been putting up with my shit all along, and my apologies for those I have been tantalizing with my never-coming-out revamped version of this project, especially hitkey and Nekokan, without whom there will never be version 3.0, and Freefire and other 4A members, without whom there will never be version 2.0.

And finally, about the development of a revamped version ... I know it has been a long time, and frankly, it's still in a very early development stage and I don't know if I will ever be able to come back to it. If you are curious and want to take a look at its current state, send me an email. I can also release that code in case of multiple requests.

- iBMSC 3.0 Delta (Jan 12, 2012):

  I apologize for not updating anything during more than 4 months ... But starting from version 3.x, iBMSC is no longer specialized for o2mania but is aiming to support all rhythm games.

  Many thanks to hitkey, who has provided me a very detailed specification about bms format in general, and without whom I can never do this much.

  Also many thanks to Nekokan, who has created a Japanese locale and provided a iBMSC theme for Feeling PoMu.

  This is probably the biggest update I have ever made to iBMSC, at least up until now. I added a main menu, support for non-quadruple measure, support for LnObj, etc., and most importantly, I have rewritten more than half of the entire code for optimization after I have started my university life and have really learned some stuff in programming.

  As a result of that, most files from previous versions of iBMSC will not be compatible will not compatible with iBMSC 3.0, including all *.cff, *.th, *.lol, *.ibmsc files. You don't have to worry about most of them, but you might need to reconfigure the program as it will not be automatically imported. 

  Many thanks to hitkey and Nekokan; iBMSC 3.0 will never come out without these guys.

BMS Speed Adjuster was first created only to change the BPM from 100 to 150 and to 200 for a bms named "A Minor in Presto" (快速a小调), created by Freefire, and the program was never published. However, this inspired me for creating a new bms editor since I was not satisfied with the features current bms editors could provide me, and there exists several compatibility issues between BMSE and O2Mania. After I slightly added some features to BMS Speed Adjuster, I realized that VB6 is quite ancient and has a lot of limitations, so I decided to learn VB.NET, and started writing iBMSC on January 3, 2011.
